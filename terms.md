The most recent version is the version that applies. If the changes include material changes that affect your rights or obligations, we will notify you in advance of the changes by reasonable means, which could include notification through the Services or via e-mail. If you continue to use the Services after the changes become effective, then you agree to the revised Agreement.

## 4. Modifying the Services and Termination

Upkats is always striving to improve the Services and bring you additional functionality that you will find engaging and useful. This means we may add new product features or enhancements from time to time as well as remove some features, and if these actions do not materially affect your rights or obligations, we may not provide you with notice before taking them. We may even suspend the Services entirely, in which event we will notify you in advance unless extenuating circumstances, such as safety or security concerns, prevent us from doing so.

You may terminate your account at any time, for any reason, by following the instructions in “Settings” in the Service, however you will need to manage your in-app purchases through your mobile device platform (e.g., iTunes, Google Play). Upkats may terminate your account at any time without notice if it believes that you have violated this Agreement. Upon such termination, you will not be entitled to any refund for purchases. After your account is terminated, this Agreement will terminate, except that the following provisions will still apply to you and Upkats: Section 4, Section 5, and Sections 12 through 19.

## 10. Purchases

### In-app Purchases

From time to time, Upkats may offer products and services for purchase (“in-app purchases”) through iTunes, Google Play or other application platforms authorized by Upkats (each, a “Software Store”). If you choose to make an in-app purchase, you will be prompted to enter details for your account with your Software Store (“your IAP Account”), and your IAP Account will be charged for the in-app purchase in accordance with the terms disclosed to you at the time of purchase as well as the general terms for in-app purchases that apply to your IAP Account. Some Software Stores may charge you sales tax, depending on where you live. If you purchase an auto-recurring periodic subscription through an in-app purchase, your IAP Account will be billed continuously for the subscription until you cancel. After your initial subscription commitment period, and again after any subsequent subscription period, your subscription will automatically continue for an additional equivalent period, at the price you agreed to when subscribing. If you do not wish your subscription to renew automatically, or if you want to change or terminate your subscription, you will need to log in to your IAP account and follow instructions to cancel your subscription, even if you have otherwise deleted your account with us or the Upkats application from your device.

### Refunds

Generally, all charges for purchases are nonrefundable, and there are no refunds or credits for partially used periods. We may make an exception if a refund is requested within fourteen days of the transaction date, providing that you have not used or received any benefits from your purchase, or if the laws applicable in your jurisdiction provide for refunds.

* an electronic or physical signature of the person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright interest;
* a description of the copyrighted work that you claim has been infringed;
* a description of where the material that you claim is infringing is located on the Service (and such description must be reasonably sufficient to enable us to find the alleged infringing material);
* your contact information, including address, telephone number and e-mail address;
* a written statement by you that you have a good faith belief that the disputed use is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and
* a statement by you, made under penalty of perjury, that the above information in your notice is accurate and that you are the copyright owner or authorized to act on the copyright owner’s behalf.

Notice of claims of copyright infringement should be provided to the Company’s Copyright Agent at [support@upkats.com](mailto:support@upkats.com?Subject=Copyright%20Infringement%20Claim) or the following address:

## 14. Limitation of Liability.

TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL UPKATS, ITS AFFILIATES, EMPLOYEES, LICENSORS OR SERVICE PROVIDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, LOSS OF PROFITS, WHETHER INCURRED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, OR ANY LOSS OF DATA, USE, GOODWILL, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES, RESULTING FROM: (I) YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF OR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE THE SERVICES, (II) THE CONDUCT OR CONTENT OF OTHER USERS OR THIRD PARTIES ON, THROUGH, OR FOLLOWING USE OF THE SERVICES; OR (III) UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS, USE OR ALTERATION OF YOUR CONTENT, EVEN IF UPKATS HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF CERTAIN DAMAGES, SO SOME OR ALL OF THE EXCLUSIONS AND LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

## 15. Arbitration, Class-Action Waiver, and Jury Waiver.

Except for users residing within the EU or European Economic Area and elsewhere where prohibited by applicable law:

<ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha">
  <li>
    The exclusive means of resolving any dispute or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement (including any alleged breach thereof) or the Service shall be BINDING ARBITRATION administered by a competent association based in Québec. The one exception to the exclusivity of arbitration is that you have the right to bring an individual claim against the Company in a small-claims court of competent jurisdiction. But whether you choose arbitration or small-claims court, you may not under any circumstances commence or maintain against the Company any class action, class arbitration, or other representative action or proceeding.
  </li>
  <li>
    By using the Service in any manner, you agree to the above arbitration agreement. In doing so, YOU GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO GO TO COURT to assert or defend any claims between you and the Company (except for matters that may be taken to small-claims court). YOU ALSO GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR OTHER CLASS PROCEEDING. Your rights will be determined by a NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR, NOT A JUDGE OR JURY, and the arbitrator shall determine all issues regarding the arbitrability of the dispute. You are entitled to a fair hearing before the arbitrator. The arbitrator can grant any relief that a court can, but you should note that arbitration proceedings are usually simpler and more streamlined than trials and other judicial proceedings. Decisions by the arbitrator are enforceable in court and may be overturned by a court only for very limited reasons. For details on the arbitration process, see our Arbitration Procedures.
  </li>
  <li>
    Any proceeding to enforce this arbitration agreement, including any proceeding to confirm, modify, or vacate an arbitration award, may be commenced in any court of competent jurisdiction. In the event that this arbitration agreement is for any reason held to be unenforceable, any litigation against the Company (except for small-claims court actions) may be commenced only in the superior court located in Joliette, Québec. You hereby irrevocably consent to the jurisdiction of those courts for such purposes.
  </li>
  <li>
    This Agreement, and any dispute between you and the Company, shall be governed by the laws of the province of Québec without regard to principles of conflicts of law.
  </li>
  <li>
    The online dispute settlement platform of the European Commission is available under http://ec.europa.eu/odr. Upkats does not take part in dispute settlement procedures in front of a consumer arbitration entity for users residing in the EU or European Economic Area.
  </li>
</ol>

## 16. Governing Law.

For users residing in the EU or European Economic Area or elsewhere where our arbitration agreement is prohibited by law, the laws of Québec, Canada, excluding Québec’s conflict of laws rules, will apply to any disputes arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the Services. For the avoidance of doubt, the choice of Québec governing law shall not supersede any mandatory consumer protection legislation in such jurisdictions.

## 17. Venue.

Except for users residing in the EU or European Economic Area, who may bring claims in their country of residence in accordance with applicable law, all claims arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the Services will be litigated exclusively in the superior court of Joliette, Québec, Canada, and you and Upkats consent to personal jurisdiction in those courts.

## 18. Indemnity by You.

You agree, to the extent permitted under applicable law, to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Upkats, our affiliates, and their and our respective officers, directors, agents, and employees from and against any and all complaints, demands, claims, damages, losses, costs, liabilities and expenses, including attorney’s fees, due to, arising out of, or relating in any way to your access to or use of the Services, your Content, or your breach of this Agreement.

## 19. Entire Agreement; Other.

This Agreement, with the Privacy Policy and any terms disclosed and agreed to by you if you purchase additional features, products or services we offer on the Service, contains the entire agreement between you and Upkats regarding the use of the Service. If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid, the remainder of this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect. The failure of the Company to exercise or enforce any right or provision of this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. You agree that your Upkats account is non-transferable and all of your rights to your account and its Content terminate upon your death. No agency, partnership, joint venture or employment is created as a result of this Agreement and you may not make any representations or bind Upkats in any manner.
